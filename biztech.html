      <p>Single bedroom apartments are a cost effective method to house lots of people in an urban area, but they leave people feeling isolated and lonely.</p>

      <p>3rd on Maslow's hierarchy of needs is the need for belonging, intimacy, and community.</p>

      <p>"Maslow called the bottom four levels of the pyramid ‘deficiency needs’ because a person does not feel anything if they are met, but <strong>becomes anxious if they are not.</strong>" <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201205/our-hierarchy-needs">-Psychology Today</a></p>
      <p>Love and belonging are hence classified as deficiency needs. A person will feel anxious if this need is not fulfilled.</p>
      <p>+</p>
      <p>Loneliness is deadly. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691614568352">study called "Loneliness and Social Isolation as Risk Factors for Mortality"</a> found that living alone increased likelihood of mortality by 32%.</p>
      <p>+</p>
      <p>Loneliness is common. In a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1188033">study with 1604 participants, 43% reported feeling lonely</a>. "Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general of the United States, has said many times in recent years that the most prevalent health issue in the country is not cancer or heart disease or obesity. <strong>It is isolation.</strong>" <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2017/03/09/the-biggest-threat-facing-middle-age-men-isn-smoking-obesity-loneliness/k6saC9FnnHQCUbf5mJ8okL/story.html">-The Boston Globe</a></p>
      <p>∴</p>
      <p>You'll likely die prematurely if you're deprived of social interaction, and it is very common to feel lonely.</p>

      <p>How does the architecture of a city contribute to feelings of loneliness?</p>

      <p>Where are the opportunity areas to combat this?</p>

      <p>"Apartments make up almost 1/3 of housing stock in America’s largest cities, with <strong>half of all of them being home to only a single person.</strong>"</p>
      <p>"This approach to architecture is part of a larger cultural obsession with privacy — a concept that is very modern relative to human history, according to Christopher Leinberger, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution."</p>
      <p>"In the 20th century, for the first time in human history, we had the opportunity to build isolated developments in metropolitan areas, and we did it with a vengeance."</p>
      <p>"Things like shared ethnicity and culture are powerful ways to create a community within a building that was never designed for one."</p>

      <p>"Living in a city is an unnatural state for human beings. [We evolved] living in small groups of around 100 to 150 people" -Colin Ellard, cognitive neuroscientist at Canada’s University of Waterloo.</p>
      <p>"Being in constant contact with strangers can lead to feelings of social isolation and loneliness, and then of course have mental health consequences."</p>
      <p>"On the surface, this may seem paradoxical: Cities are full of people—an antidote to loneliness. But living anonymously alongside millions of others can actually leave us isolated. Case in point: London is the loneliest place in the UK, according to a survey by <a href="http://www.comresglobal.com/polls/bbc-religion-loneliness-survey/">ComRes</a>."</p>
      <p>"With this in mind, making cities less stressful is crucial. For Ellard, this means policies that encourage people to cycle or walk, as well as noise bylaws and more green spaces. Better urban design may help mitigate loneliness, too."</p>

      <p>"The way cities are designed can also contribute to levels of loneliness, including the ever-growing trend of replacing public spaces with more blocks of unaffordable flats."</p>
      <p>"The trick is to help people to feel a little bit more connected to strangers, and that can be done by generating positive moods in public places."</p>
      <p>"Shared common areas may hold the answer – giving us more chance of connecting with others."</p>
      <p><em>What about using technology to connect people?</em> "Being in constant virtual contact with friends or family may feel sociable, but research suggests this isn’t necessarily the case. A <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(17)30016-8/fulltext">US study</a> published last year found those who spend over two hours a day on social media are more likely to feel socially isolated."</p>

      <p>Q: Why did you move out of the city?</p>

      <p>"All my friends in Italy are jealous of my new life in Amsterdam. They assume everything must be great because I have a good job, my English is improving and I live in a great city. It sounds amazing from the outside, but it's not really true for me."</p>
      <p>"Most people look forward to the weekend, but for me, it’s the other way around – I look forward to Monday so I can speak to people at work. I feel really down on Fridays, because I start thinking about how I’m going to spend another weekend alone, mainly cleaning my room and playing on my computer. When I do venture outside, it’s almost always just for the sake of it – I go to a bar or grab a quick coffee, then I go home and feel alone again. It’s the same every weekend"</p>

      <p>Architect Grace Kim thinks that the solution is cohousing.</p>
      <p>Kim lives and works in a cohousing community she designed in Seattle, where families or individuals each have their own homes, but the space was designed for interaction.</p>
      <p>In the common house, everyone dines together three times a week, taking turns cooking for each other. Kim only cooks once every six weeks; two other times, she helps with prep and cleanup.</p>
      <p>"It turns out when you eat together, you start planning more activities together."</p>
      <p>"When you eat together, you share more things. You start to watch each other’s kids. You lend each other power tools. You borrow each other’s cars."</p>
      <p>"When I said earlier that cohousing is an antidote to isolation, what I should have said is that cohousing can save your life."</p>

      <p>This is the beautiful city I call home: Vancouver, Canada. I remember the infectious cheeriness and laid-back attitude of the strangers I grew up with, and while that assessment may be through rose-coloured lenses, the downtown core is surrounded on all ends by beach area. I think this proximity to a scenic walks along the beach are crucial to combatting feelings of isolation when you live in Vancouver.</p>
